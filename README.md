● Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX.

● Industry Context:
In the HR domain, employee retention and workforce management are critical. This project focused on identifying attrition trends and salary patterns to help HR leaders improve retention strategies and workforce planning.


● Project Objective:
To build an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing employee attrition, salary distribution, and departmental performance — reducing manual reporting and enabling proactive HR strategies.


● About Data:
Dataset of 5,000+ employee records with attributes such as Employee ID, Age, Department, Education, Salary, Tenure, and Attrition Status.

● Actionable Insights:
1.	Identified departments with the highest attrition rates.
2.	Found correlation between salary bands and attrition.
3.	Revealed high retention in teams with consistent growth opportunities.
4.	Highlighted the impact of tenure on employee turnover.
5.	Uncovered gender and age group patterns affecting retention.


● Key Results:
Reduced manual reporting time by 40% and improved employee retention analysis by 15% through data-driven insights.

● Business Impact:
Enabled HR to proactively identify attrition drivers, plan compensation strategies, and enhance workforce stability through visual analytics.


● Expected Interview Questions:
